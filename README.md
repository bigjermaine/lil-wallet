# lil wallet

welcome to lil wallet. it's an open-source Ethereum wallet built with SwiftUI

there are two main views - coins and objects. coins are your tokens like ETH, etc. objects are your NFTs

this is an early version. lots of stuff might be broken, including sometimes slow loading times.

i'm sharing the first version, and hoping the community can take it from here!

### todos
- [ ] better data handling (needs lots of optionals cleanup)
- [ ] speed improvements (not great rn)
- [ ] data caching (don't make fresh requests every time)
- [ ] support more NFT types (videos, etc)
- [ ] sorting coins list?

### data                       
- [Zerion](https://docs.zerion.io) (portfolio, transactions, tokens)
- [OpenSea](https://docs.opensea.io) (NFTs)
